        <p class="dm-story">
          It was a dark night. Dark, yet clear. The moon was clear and bright in
          the sky above, and through the wood, a young girl of pale complexion
          and infernal blood was running for her life. She just finished 16
          winters and now the only thing on her mind was that she may not
          experience the 17th one. Running and running through the dense foliage
          of the dark woods, her long, beautiful dress was cut by branches and
          muddied from every fall. Yet, she needed to run. Her life depended on
          that. It was a story as old as there were daughters of dukes. An
          assassination? Maybe. An abduction? Possible. Some religious purists
          wanting to rid this world from the infernal taint? Well, that’s a very
          personal kind of problem. Even though she tried to hide it with
          luxurious hairstyling and expensive accessories, you can only do so
          much with those horns and long ears. Still, that dint matter now. Now,
          she needed to run. Whoever was hunting her was close.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          The light from their torches was clear to see. Run, fall, run, and
          once again, fall. This time, there was a problem; a slope. The girl
          dove right into a dark abyss. To some, it's a curse, to others, a
          blessing, but to her? it was both. Battered and bruised, she ended up
          in a deep hole hidden in the foliage with no way of getting out. As
          she was lying there, the only sounds she could hear were the shouts
          the men that hunted her.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          By the star’s grace, they walked past and left her behind. One problem
          dealt with. Another now, however, is started to sink in. She was
          doomed. She was doomed to live out the rest of her life in this pit. A
          short life, a very short life indeed. Well, with that said, she
          possesses something that most people don’t have; magic. However it
          would be not much help here except for making a fire from the twigs
          that were lying around.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          For two days, she managed to get by. She had heat from the fire she
          conjured up, but water was down to pure luck. Fortunately, it happened
          to rain for a while and her hydration issues were solved.
          Unfortunately, malnutrition was kicking in. Hunger truly had become
          unbearable.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          To some, this would be a wakeup call for them to use their last ounce
          of strength to somehow escape. Al least, that’s how stories go. But
          not for the girl. Her legs were bruised severely and she never shined
          in the physical department. Even the simple fact that she managed to
          last that long defied all odds. But even if she managed to climb out,
          a pack of wolves were circling around her muddy prison. All was lost.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          Then, all of a sudden, she heard the skirmishing sound of whimpering
          animals. As she looked up, she saw a hooded figure looking into the
          deep hole. "You… need… help?" the figured said in a way like if
          someone was just learning the basics of a language. "Please stranger,
          I don’t know how much longer I can take," She replied. Let Hell take
          the caution. This was her only chance. So, she decided to beg the
          stranger for help. There was no reply and the figure disappeared. That
          was the longest 10 minutes of her life.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          Was that just her imagination? Was madness already setting in? As she
          started to cry and contemplate her own sanity, an end of a rope hit
          her on her head. "Tie to waist. I pull." The figure said. She wiped
          her tears and did as told. When she was done tying, she felt the rope
          tighten across her abdomen and she began to rise. As she was pulled
          up, true joy came over her. All the possibilities that could happen,
          good or bad, did not matter. She was ascending out of that dark and
          damp pit.
        </p>
        <p class="dm-story">
          When she finally rose out of the hole and on to the surface, she had
          taken a moment. She spent a short second to thank the heavens and shed
          tears for finally breaking out of her prison. When she composed
          herself and turned to the kind stranger who helped her, terror
          overcame her. That was no normal man. It was a kid. No more than ten
          winters, maybe eleven. Although, this was not the source of her fear.
          No. It was those purple eyes. The eyes of the Templars. The eyes of
          those who were considered sinners, monsters, undeserving. Eyes of
          those who were the most savage and brutal soldiers that the Empire
          subjugated and turned into a personal army of Death.
