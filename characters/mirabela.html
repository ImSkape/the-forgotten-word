    <h2>DM stories</h2>
    <p>
      It was a dark night. Dark, yet clear. The moon was clear and bright in the
      sky above, and through the wood, a young girl of pale complexion and
      infernal blood was running for her life. She just finished 16 winters and
      now the only thing on her mind was that she may not experience the 17th
      one. Running and running through the dense foliage of the dark woods, her
      long, beautiful dress was cut by branches and muddied from every fall.
      Yet, she needed to run. Her life depended on that. It was a story as old
      as there were daughters of dukes. An assassination? Maybe. An abduction?
      Possible. Some religious purists wanting to rid this world from the
      infernal taint? Well, that’s a very personal kind of problem. Even though
      she tried to hide it with luxurious hairstyling and expensive accessories,
      you can only do so much with those horns and long ears. Still, that dint
      matter now. Now, she needed to run. Whoever was hunting her was close. The
      light of their torches was clear to see. Run, fall, run, and once again,
      fall. This time, there was a problem though. A slope, and she dived right
      into a dark abyss. To some, this is a curse, but to others, a blessing. To
      her, it was both. Battered and bruised, she ended up in a deep hole hidden
      in the foliage with no way of getting out. As she was lying there, the
      only sound she could hear was the men that hunted her. By the star’s
      grace, they walked past and left her behind. One problem dealt with.
      Another now started to sink in. She was doomed. She was doomed to live out
      the rest of her life in this hole. A short life, very short life. Well,
      that said, she poses something that would help her that many people don’t
      have. Magic. Though it would be not much help here, except for making a
      fire from the twigs that were lying there. For 2 days, she managed to get
      by, but unfortunately, malnutrition was kicking in. She had heat from the
      fire she could conjure up, and water was down to pure luck. It happened to
      rain a fair while, so she managed to get by. But now, hunger truly had
      become unbearable. To some, this would be a wakeup call for the last ounce
      of strength to try to get out. That’s at least how stories go. But not
      her. Her legs were bruised severely, and she never belonged to those that
      had much in the physical department. Even the simple fact that she managed
      to last that long defied all odds. But even if she managed to get out, a
      pack of wolves were circling around her muddy prison. All was lost. Then,
      she heard the skirmishing sound of whimpering animals. And as she looked
      up, she saw a hooded head looking into the deep hole. "You… need… help?"
      the figured said in the way of someone who just learned the basics of a
      language. "Please stranger, I don’t know how long I can take it more," She
      replied. Let Hell take the caution. This was her only chance. So, she
      decided to beg the stranger for help. There was no reply and the figure
      disappeared. That was the longest 10 minutes of her life. Was that just
      her imagination? Was madness already setting in? As she started to cry and
      contemplate her own sanity, a piece of rope hit her on her head. "Tie to
      waist. I pull." The figure said. She wiped her tears and did as told. As
      she was pulled up, true joy came over her. All the possibilities that
      could happen, good or bad, it did not matter. True joy was overcoming her
      from the simple thing, ascending out of that dark, damp hole. When she
      finally rose out of the hole and on to the surface, she had taken a
      moment. A short second to thank the heavens and shed tears for finally
      getting out. When she composed herself and turned to the kind stranger who
      helped her, terror overcome her. That was no normal man. It was a kid. No
      more than 10 winters. Maybe 11. But this was not the source of her fear.
      No. it was those purple eyes. The eyes of the Templars. The eyes of those
      that were considered sinners, monsters, undeserving. Eyes of those that
      were the most savage and brutal soldiers that the Empire subjugated and
      turned into a personal army of Death.
