    <h1>Mirabela</h1>
    <p>
      Part succubus. Claims to want to be a mother figure to us but there's a
      lot of contention to that. She is very helpful though. She was apparently
      Petruzzo's... GF? She leads The Followers of the lunar eclipse which
      Srebash is apart of.
    </p>
    <p>As a witch, Mirabel focuses on curses.</p>
    <p>
      Being a powerful witch, Mirabel has helped us with suplies and information
      throughout our journeys in the Merky Den.
