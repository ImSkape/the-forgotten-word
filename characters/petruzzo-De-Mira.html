    <h1>Petruzzo De'Mira</h1>
    <p>
      Father figure but a mystery for the most part. He is apart of the Ank'Mari
      and the Templar but for some reason doesn't have the same vendetta that
      the others have. We are unsure what will happen if he finds out that they
      are back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petruzzo is a member of the seekers as well as the Ank'Mari. There is
      definetely contention in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being killed in a void raid, he mysteriously became undead with no
      understanding why. To our knowledge, it is because of his line to the
      Ank'Mari and a prophecy that turned him undead.
    </p>
    <p>
      After becoming undead, his appearance changed a bit. He is now mostly
      rotten and skeletal and also has 1 blue and 1 purple eye. He usually likes
      to wear hooded cloaks now...
    </p>
    <p>
      Petruzzo's relationship with Mirabel is... well... complicated. While he
      has totally regretted his decisions that led to this point, Mirabela still
      shows the utmost affection toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petruzzo has had a rough past. From being apart of a race who were
      indoctrinated that they were only good to war and eventually being
      erraticated to a group of seekers who's leader was murdered that broke the
      group up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petruzzo's contention to the Ank'Mari makes things extremely complicated.
      We know that they will be coming towards our location inevitably, but we
      can't tell Petruzzo just yet in fear that he will turn to them due to them
      being his family of old.
