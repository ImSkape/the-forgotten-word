        <p class="lore-story">
          As the world decends into darkness and the void terrorizes the world,
          three young children, Bosna, Herold, and Ashlyn, are being taken by a
          caravan to a dwarven city for refuge. However, after making the
          distance, it is realized that the place has already fallen to the void
          as the caravan is attacked. The only ones to survive that day were
          those three kids, nearly escaping a void beast and taking off into the
          wasteland. Almost freezing to death in the frigid wasteland, the
          children were rescued by a mysterious figure named Petruzzo De'Mira.
        </p>
        <p class="lore-story">
          Petruzzo De'Mira is a complicated man. He doesn't talk much about his
          past, but whatever it was, it has clearly made him very jaded and
          distant to most. He's a member of the Seekers, a group of highly
          trained scouts proficient in traversing the wasteland and the complex
          underground cave systems. Somehow, he found himself with a group of
          children on the brink of death.
        </p>
        <p class="lore-story">
          Feeling something for these kids, Petruzzo took them to the City of
          Cinders where they can grow up in an orphanage. Of course, he couldn't
          just leave them there without visiting from time to time. So, every
          once in a while, he'd make time in his plans to stop by or write a
          letter. Once, he even got gifts for them. But, one day, those visits
          stopped and the letters ran dry.
        </p>
        <p class="lore-story">
          For eleven years, the kids grew up in the city, occasionally being
          visited Petruzzo or receiving one of his letters. But, for the rest of
          the time, they were on their own. They had to figure out this twisted
          world with nothing but each other. Each one of them did something that
          they resonated with them. Bosna started learning how to become a
          stalker, the closest thing you can become to a Seeker without having
          certain connections, Herold became a part of some resistances to fight
          the tyranny the city, and Ashlyn turned her pain into rage as she
          began to fight in the streets and even arenas.
