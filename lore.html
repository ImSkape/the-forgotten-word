      As the world decends into darkness and the void terrorizes the world, 3
      your children are being taken by caravan to a dwarven city for refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after getting there, it is realized that the place has already
      been taken by the void and the caravan is attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only people to survive that day were those 3 kids as they barely
      escaped a void beast and took off into the wasteland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost dying in the wasteland, the kids were rescued by a mysterious
      figure named Petruzzo De'Mira.

      grow up in an orphanage.
